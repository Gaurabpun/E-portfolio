            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>This project involved creating a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                It showcases my understanding of front-end development and design principles.</p>

            <div id="project1-details" class="project-details">
                <p>This project was one of my first hands-on experiences building a website from scratch. 
                    I used HTML to create the structure of the pages, CSS to design and style the layout, and JavaScript to add interactive features.
                    The goal was to make a simple and clean website that works well on both computers and phones.
                    I learned how to organize content clearly and how to style it so it looks modern and easy to read. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also focused on improving user experience by adding smooth scrolling, hover effects, and a fixed navigation bar. 
                    Later, I added animations that make different parts of the website fade in as the user scrolls down. 
                    These small features helped me understand how websites can feel more alive and engaging. 
                    This project helped me get more comfortable with writing code and seeing real results in the browser.

            <h3>Connect Bridge - Hackathon Project</h3>
            <p>This website was built during the Spring 2025 LaGuardia Hackathon. 
                It helps students connect with career services, mentors, and workshops. 
                The front-end was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on user experience for international and local students alike.

                    Career Connect was developed by a four-member student team as part of the Spring 2025 Hackathon at LaGuardia Community College. 
                    The platform is designed to help students especially international students find internships, mentors, and relevant campus resources more easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project includes features like major and skill-based internship filtering, links to external job platforms, and an email contact system for organizations.
                    We focused on accessibility, clean navigation, and mobile responsiveness to ensure the tool is practical for all students.
                    This was a collaborative experience where we divided tasks by frontend, backend, content, and UI/UX design. 
                    It deepened my understanding of teamwork in web development.

            <h3>AI Chatbot</h3>
            <p>In this project, I built a simple AI chatbot using Python and machine learning libraries, 
                focusing on natural language processing and user interaction.</p>
            <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleDetails('project3-details')">Learn more</a>
            <div id="project3-details" class="project-details">
                <p>This project is my introduction to artificial intelligence and natural language processing. 
                    I‚Äôm building a basic chatbot using Python and a library called NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). 
                    The chatbot can understand simple questions and reply based on patterns I trained it to recognize. 
                    I wrote code to process what the user types, break the message into smaller parts (called tokenization), and find a response that matches. 
                    This helped me understand how machines can read and respond to human language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is still in progress. 
                    I plan to keep improving it by adding better responses, expanding the topics it can understand, and making the conversation flow more naturally. 
                    I also want to try connecting it to a simple website so users can chat through a browser. 
                    So far, it has been a fun way to learn about AI, and I‚Äôm excited to keep working on it.
